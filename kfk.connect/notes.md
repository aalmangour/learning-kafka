## Kafka Connect - Learn How to Source Twitter Data, Store in Apache Kafka Topics & Sink in ElasticSearch and PostgreSQL

```

- Kafka Connect is a tool for scalable and reliable streaming data between Apache Kafka and other data systems. 
- Apache Kafka Connect is a common framework for Apache Kafka producers and consumers.

- Apache Kafka Connect offers an API, Runtime, and REST Service to enable developers to define connectors 
  that move large data sets into and out of Apache Kafka in real time. 
- It inherits strong concepts such as fault-tolerance and elasticity thanks to being an extension of Apache Kafka. 
- Kafka Connect can ingest entire databases, collect metrics, gather logs from all your application servers into 
  Apache Kafka topics, making the data available for stream processing with low latency.

- Kafka Connect standardises integration of other data systems with Apache Kafka, simplifying connector development, deployment, and management.

- we are going to learn the Kafka Connector deployment, 
          configuration and management with hands-on exercises
          We are also going to see the distributed and standalone modes to scale up to a large, 
          centrally managed service supporting an entire organisation or scale down to development, 
          testing, and small production deployments. 
          The REST interface to submit and manage connectors to your Kafka Connect cluster via an easy to use REST API’s.


Overview of the Course Contents -
