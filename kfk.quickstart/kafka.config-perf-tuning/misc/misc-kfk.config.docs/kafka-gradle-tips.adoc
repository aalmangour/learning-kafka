== Gradle Tips

=== Building Kafka Distribution

```
gradle -PscalaVersion=2.11.8 clean releaseTarGz install
```

It takes around 2 minutes (after all the dependencies were downloaded once).

After the command, you can unpack the release as follows:

```
tar -zxvf core/build/distributions/kafka_2.11-0.10.1.0-SNAPSHOT.tgz
```

=== Executing Single Test

```
gradle -PscalaVersion=2.11.8 :core:test --no-rebuild --tests "*PlaintextProducerSendTest"
```
