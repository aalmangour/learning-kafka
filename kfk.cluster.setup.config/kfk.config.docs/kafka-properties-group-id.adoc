== [[group.id]] group.id Property

`group.id` specifies the name of the consumer group a link:kafka-consumer-KafkaConsumer.adoc[Kafka consumer] belongs to.

When the Kafka consumer is constructed and `group.id` does not exist yet (i.e. there are no existing consumers that are part of the group), the consumer group will be created automatically.

NOTE: If all consumers in a group leave the group, the group is automatically destroyed.
