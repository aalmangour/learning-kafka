== Zookeeper Tips

The zookeeper shell shipped with Kafka works with no support for command line history because jline jar is missing (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-2385[KAFKA-2385]).

A solution is to use the official distribution of Apache Zookeeper (*3.4.10* as of this writing) from http://zookeeper.apache.org/releases.html[Apache ZooKeeper Releases].

Once downloaded, use `./bin/zkCli.sh` to connect to Zookeeper that is used for Kafka.

```
$ ./bin/zkCli.sh -server localhost:2181
...
JLine support is enabled

[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 0] ls /
[cluster, controller_epoch, controller, brokers, zookeeper, admin, isr_change_notification, consumers, log_dir_event_notification, latest_producer_id_block, config]

[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 5] get /controller
