== [[Cluster]] Cluster (deprecated)

[IMPORTANT]
====
It _seems_ that `Cluster` class is created using link:kafka-ZkUtils.adoc#getCluster[ZkUtils.getCluster] that is used exclusively when `ZKRebalancerListener` does link:kafka-ZKRebalancerListener.adoc#syncedRebalance[syncedRebalance] (that in turn happens for the currently-deprecated `ZookeeperConsumerConnector`).

In other words, `Cluster` class and the page are _soon_ to be removed.
====

`kafka.cluster.Cluster` private class represents a set of active brokers in a Kafka cluster.

NOTE: There is also `org.apache.kafka.common.Cluster`.
